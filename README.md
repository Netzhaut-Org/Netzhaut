# Netzhaut
 
Netzhaut is a **multi-purpose open-source web-browser-engine** written from scratch in **C99**. Web-Browser-Engines are software systems which run web content on client machines. Popular examples are Chromium (Chrome), Gecko (Firefox) and WebKit (Safari). 

The project is currently in the **experimental** phase and thus not usable. 

The documentation for this project, apart from code-documentation, is fully contained in this document.
