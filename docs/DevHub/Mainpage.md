\section Development Development

A few points to note:  
* Development happens on development branches, not on the master branch.  
* Trusted developers merge finalized development branches into the master branch.  
* Prior to merging a development branch with the master branch, all commits on the development branch must have been flattened into one commit.  
* Development branches should only be named after the Netzhaut revision they represent, e.g. 'v0.1.4' 'v1.3.7-beta.2' ...  
* Whenever something non-trivial was changed or added, make sure it's documented properly in the [Changelog](Changelog.html).
* Netzhaut follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) conventions.
