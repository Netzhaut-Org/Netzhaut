* The [Target](Target.html) gives the project a **guideline** and a **clear vision**.     
* The [Changelog](Changelog.html) documents non-trivial changes for all revisions.  
* The [Work Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQz61VU6MCuYPH89Aygo6a45UfSqIRGR_mkZMOD7HbghzJxobEOpKuPpgFC_kHIjWVyHnwhxZvMwHCG/pub) shows who is currently doing what, thus greatly improving **team collaboration** and **transparency**. 
It also keeps track of all updates that are currently being worked on with up-to-date information.    
* The [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tXyuZpm) keeps development **organized** by providing communication channels. 
Everyone is welcome, but you are encouraged to join especially if you want to participate.
For everyone else please consider submitting an [issue](https://github.com/DajoFrey/Netzhaut/issues/new), since these are publicly accessible and may help others.
* The [Github Repository](https://github.com/DajoFrey/Netzhaut) contains everything including code, docs, data, [license](https://github.com/DajoFrey/Netzhaut/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) and the [README](https://github.com/DajoFrey/Netzhaut/blob/master/README.md).  

\section Development Development

* Development happens on development branches, not on the master branch.  
* Development branches should only be named after the Netzhaut revision they represent, e.g. 'v0.1.4' 'v1.3.7-beta.2' etc.. 
The branch-name should be updated whenever the corresponding revision changes.  
* Trusted developers merge finalized development branches into the master branch. For merging with the master branch, only [squash merging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5308816/how-to-use-git-merge-squash) is allowed.  
* Developers need to check the 'PRA' entry in the [Work Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQz61VU6MCuYPH89Aygo6a45UfSqIRGR_mkZMOD7HbghzJxobEOpKuPpgFC_kHIjWVyHnwhxZvMwHCG/pub) before issuing a pull request for a specific development branch.   
* Whenever something non-trivial was changed or added, make sure it's documented properly in the correct [Changelog](Changelog.html) entry. 
In general, make sure that the changelog entry quality is 'on par' with previous entries before merging into the master branch.
* Netzhaut follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) conventions.
