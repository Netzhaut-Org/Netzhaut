  The project is still in its infancy but it is past the prototype stage. It is still far off from being ready for its release though.
  Don't expect anything to work right now, web pages are a crazy mix of different technologies and most still need to be implemented.
  However, Netzhaut is already able to interpret very basic CSS, HTML and JS, which means that the foundation is laid.

  Netzhaut rendered the first webpage not so long ago, which was a milestone, so I decided to make the repository public because why not.
