<div style="width:700px; background-color: #EEEEEE;">
This update brings rewrites for quite a lot of routines and some bugfixes. Among the most important improvements are better CSS selector handling and simpler HTML document recomputation. Some restructuring makes the source code more accessible. Also, the changelog received a new style. Feature wise, only very small things were added, like support for the 'first-of-type' CSS pseudo class.
